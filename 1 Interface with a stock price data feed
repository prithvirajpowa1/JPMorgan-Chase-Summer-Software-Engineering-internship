Task 1
*****Interface with a stock price data feed*****

Interface with a stock price data feed and set up your system for analysis of the data

Here is the background information on your task
You’ve been asked to assist with some development to add a chart to a trader’s dashboard allowing them to better identify under/over-valued stocks.

The trader would like to be able to monitor two historically correlated stocks and be able to visualize when the correlation between the two weakens (i.e. one stock moves proportionally more than the historical correlation would imply). This could indicate a potential trade strategy to simultaneously buy the relatively underperforming stock and sell the relatively outperforming stock. Assuming the two prices subsequently converge, the trade should be profitable.

Most data visualization for our traders is built on JPMorgan Chase's Perspective data visualization software, which is now open source. If you want to explore that, a link is provided in the resources section. 

Before implementing this request using perspective, first you’ll need to interface with the relevant financial data feed and make the necessary adjustments to facilitate the monitoring of potential trade opportunities.

* Understanding the finance and trading part is not required.

* Being familiar with python scripting language and command line basics is not required as you will be guided in this exercise

* (Note, you DO NOT have to install Perspective as an individual software onto your machine. All you need to complete this task is to follow the instructions in step 3)


Here is your task
For the first module of this project will need you to accomplish the following:

Set up your system by downloading the necessary repository, files, tools and dependencies
Fix the broken client datafeed script in the repository by making the required adjustments to it.
Generate a patch file of the changes you made
Bonus task: Add unit tests in the test script in the repository.

We've broken down the steps for you in stages below so you can accomplish this task in an organized manner.

Set Up

Before you can tackle any software or development task you need to set up your development environment. Your development environment refers to your system having all the required software installed to modify the code, as well as getting the code of the project itself onto your computer.

Task 2
*****Use JPMorgan Chase frameworks and tools*****
Implement the Perspective open source code in preparation for data visualization

Here is the background information on your task
Typically, traders monitor stock prices and trading strategies by having data displayed visually on their screens in chart form. Often these charts will be accompanied by alerts that notify users when certain events occur or when preset price thresholds are hit.

JPMorgan Chase created the Perspective tool over many years to allows users to present and manipulate data feeds visually in web applications.

Perspective provides a set of flexible data transforms, such as pivots, filters, and aggregations. It utilizes bleeding-edge browser technology such as Web Assembly and Apache Arrow and is unmatched in browser performance. It is engineered for reliability and production-vetted on the JPMorgan Chase trading floor and is now available to the development community as Open Source. If you want to explore that, a link is provided in the resources section. 

* Understanding the finance and trading part is not required for this task.

* Being familiar with python scripting language, command line basics, javascript, react and typescript are not required for this task too as you will be guided in this exercise

* (Note, you DO NOT have to install Perspective as an individual software onto your machine. All you need to complete this task is to follow the instructions in step 3)


Here is your task
For the second module of this project will need you to accomplish the following:

Set up your system by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies.
Fix the broken typescript files in repository to make the web application output correctly
Generate a patch file of the changes you made.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 3
*****Display data visually for traders*****
Use Perspective to create the chart for the trader’s dashboard
Here is the background information on your task
Being able to access and  adjust data feeds is critical to any trading analysis and stock price monitoring. From the previous tasks, we now have the adjusted data set up on your systems and being piped into Perspective.

For traders to have a complete picture of all the trading strategies being monitored, several screens typically display an assortment of live and historical data at their workstation.

Given there is a lot of information and data being produced at once, visualizing data in a clear manner with UI/UX considerations accounted for is critical to providing traders with the tools to improve their performance.

* Understanding the finance and trading part is not required for this task.

* Being familiar with python scripting language, command line basics, javascript, react and typescript are not required for this task too as you will be guided in this exercise

* (Note, you DO NOT have to install Perspective as an individual software onto your machine. All you need to complete this task is to follow the instructions in step 3)


Here is your task

For the third module of this project will need you to accomplish the following:

Set up your system by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies. 
Modify the typescript files in repository to make the web application behave in the expected manner
Generate a patch file of the changes you made.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 4
*****Bonus task: Open source contribution*****
Make a contribution to Perspective or other project backlogs

*************Here is the background information on your task
The open source software has become an integral part of the global technology community - this is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

An example of open source software is the JPMorgan Chase. Perspective framework that you've just become familiar with in this virtual experience.

************Here is your task
This is a bonus task and you can think of it as separate to the previous tasks (and entirely optional).

This is an opportunity, should you wish, to look further at either Perspective or another open source project of interest to you and to make a contribution to the community.

We'd be very interested to hear about your contributions - so feel free to submit pull requests with improvements to a core app, tackle some of the open issues or even help improve the documentation of a project.

Don't feel as though you must participate in this task, but we are always interested to hear from those that are.

Log any patch files and link any pull requests that you may have done in the submission area below. Alternatively, simply tell us (text/audio/video formats are fine) about any plans or ideas for future contributions.
